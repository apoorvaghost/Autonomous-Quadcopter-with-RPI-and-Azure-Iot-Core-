# Autonomous-Quadcopter-with-RPI-and-Azure-Iot-Core-
This project is Work in Progress for more Better PID control for Autonomous Quadcopter With Only Using GPIO pins of Raspberry pi connected to cloud by Azure Iot Core.  There are so many improvisation yet to make it more stable PID and less power usage with GPIO pins .. Stay tuned
